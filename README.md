Retail Set data analysis
Analysing a retail dataset consisting of 3 csv files: sales data, stores data and Features data. The features_data file cosnists of variables 
such as Store, Date, Temperature, Fuel Price, Markdown1, Markdown2, Markdown3, Markdown4, Markdown5, CPI(Cosnumer Price Index), 
the Unemployment Rate and if its a holiday (True or False)
The sales data file consists of store, department, date, weekly sales and if its a holiday
The stores data file consists of stores_id, the type of store and its size.
The analysis helps find the month during a year where the sales have the maximum dip and the variable which causes it. The factors which plays
a major influence on increasing the weekly sales are also analysed to help the company decide how to increase their sales.
R is used to clean the data. Preproecssing of data involves importing the csv files in R. The missing values are replaced by mean in case of 
continuous variables and by modes in case of categorical variables. The data type of each variable is studied and the correct datatype is applied.
R version 3.6.1 is used. R studio is installed. A working directory is set. All the 3 files are put in the working directory.
Tableau Desktop is used for Data visualization
